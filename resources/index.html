					Jesus in the centre and His disciples around Him; that is London First Disciples. In the spirit of Christ-centeredness, we seek fulfillment both individually and collectively in worship, fellowship, discipleship, service and missions.
					</br></br>
					London First Disciples is the English speaking congregation within the London First Korean Presbyterian Church. We want to provide the best environment for each believer to grow as a disciple of Jesus and as a disciple-maker, because we believe both the mission of the church and the mission of each individual are making disciples. We’re not interested in the number of Sunday worship attendance. But we are truly interested to know how many among us are Jesus’ disciples who have completely surrendered their lives to Him.
					</br></br>
					How about you? Are you a disciple? A work in progress? Why don’t you join your fellow "strugglers" who struggle not for second-rate stuff but for the most important thing in life?
					</br></br></br>
					Rev. Young Ho Yoon

					London First Disciples exists to glorify God and to make disciples.
					<br><br>
					Here at LFD we center all of our ministries around <b>The Great Commission</b>.
					<div class="quote" >
						<p id="about-verse">“Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.”<br></p>
						<p id="about-verse1">Matthew 28:19-20</p>
					</div>
					The biblical call to making disciples is the mission statement for the church.
					<br><br>
					Jesus made disciples by selecting a few into whom he poured his life. In the same way, we want God’s Kingdom to be founded on deep and indestructible convictions of the minds of a few, not on the shifting sands of superficial impressions on the minds of many. Hence, LFD makes disciples through the <strong>man-to-man discipleship method</strong>, believing that disciples cannot be mass produced, but are the product of intimate and personal investment.
					<br><br>
					A discipleship relationship is one where a leader and follower intentionally walk alongside each other, with the leader encouraging, correcting, and challenging the follower in love to grow toward maturity in Christ. A leader is someone who is committed to God and committed to their follower, doing and teaching exactly as they were taught. A follower learns faith and life personally from a leader who lives by the Word of God, serves with their leader in the work of the gospel, and obeys and submits to their leader.
